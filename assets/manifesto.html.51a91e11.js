Use tools for what they&#39;re made to do</h2><p>Where possible, don&#39;t design outside of your tool. That is not to say don&#39;t try learn mastery of tools and only stick to a subset of features in a language or framework, but to make choice design decisions take are complemented by the toolset available to you.</p><h2 id="_2-the-api-needs-to-map-well-to-the-real-thing" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_2-the-api-needs-to-map-well-to-the-real-thing" aria-hidden="true">#</a> 2. The API needs to map well to the real thing</h2><p>Lucky in our case we already have a strict interface that we must comply with and that is the CAN Bus specification (most notably ISO 11898). There is not much point in trying to abstract away this interface too much given the intended target audience is people who are close to the metal in their embedded systems anyway. Make your interface match reality and you will be rewarded.</p><h2 id="_3-immitate-tools-with-good-ideas" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_3-immitate-tools-with-good-ideas" aria-hidden="true">#</a> 3. Immitate tools with good ideas</h2><p>With not much experience to draw from as this is a relatively new project, draw on the lessons learned by projects with more years under their belt. SchemaCAN is largely constructed around the ideals of Kubernetes manifests, which in turn are constructed around the Kubernetes API. This is no mistake and there are pleanty of other ideas stolen like the type names being consice and meaningful like those from the Zig programming language.</p><h2 id="_4-operate-on-the-basis-of-continual-improvement-but-be-careful-in-your-order-of-optomisation" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_4-operate-on-the-basis-of-continual-improvement-but-be-careful-in-your-order-of-optomisation" aria-hidden="true">#</a> 4.
